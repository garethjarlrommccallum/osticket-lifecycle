<h2>Lifecycle Stages: Intake, Assignment and Communication</h2>


<p>
After creating a ticket regarding the mobile banking system as user Ken Doe, I logged into the Agent Portal as John Doe. I could then view the created ticket. I took note of the status, priority, SLA, and department. Next, I assigned the ticket to the Online Banking team, and set the SLA to Sev-A due to it being a critical business issue. I also was sure to change the "Help Topic" from Report a Problem to Business Critical Outage due to it's severity and impact. Due to the high impact of the issue, I contacted the user who created the ticket on the phone to get more information as soon as possible. I documented the information inside the ticket for the rest of the Online Banking team to view as well. After speaking with the customer on the phone I made sure to add a reply to the ticket to give more information to the team and customer promptly.

Next, I worked the issue and determined the cause of the problem. After making sure the issue was fixed and the Online Banking portal was working correctly, I posted a reply to the ticket detailing my findings, and marked the ticket as resolved.
